Django and Tailwind are an incredible combo! 
Thank you for introducing them to me.
It was a pleasure to work with.

I have completed:
	a list view of post(homepage)
	Detail view of each post
	Create a post
	Posts persist using a database to store them

The following models are present in my application
	Post model(that has title, description, foreign key to the author, created date
	Author model(name, bio)

Bonus items:
	Edit an existing post(Title, Category, Body)
	Delete an existing post(removes it from database)
	Register Account(User can register an account so that they can add/edit post)
	Login(User can log in and will see somethings differently, gaining more options)
	Logout(User can logout)
	Dark/Light Mode
